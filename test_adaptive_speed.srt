1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Short text fits easily.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
This is a medium length subtitle that should fit comfortably within two seconds.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is an extremely long subtitle with way too much text that will require significant speed adjustment to fit within just one second of allocated time.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Normal paced sentence that fits perfectly.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
This final subtitle has a generous amount of time allocated so the speech can be nice and relaxed at a comfortable natural pace.
